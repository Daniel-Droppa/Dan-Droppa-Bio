<br>
<p>I am a graduate of Johnson & Wales University with a bachelors in culinary and food service managment. I have worked in the industry for six years and am looking to change carriers to somthing I am more passionate about. Problem solving and figuring things out is something I really enjoy and I have always enjoyed the idea of coding. Over the next few months I am expecting to fully dive into the coding world and graduate the program ready to start a full time carrier with a company in the industry. </p>
